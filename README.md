# WWW Redirector

This is a static GitHub Pages site that instantly redirects from `www.yourdomain.com` to `yourdomain.com`.

## Setup

1. Update `index.html` with your non-www domain.
2. Push to `main`.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repo settings (deploy from root).
4. Point your `www.` DNS (CNAME or A record) to GitHub Pages.

That's it. ðŸš€
